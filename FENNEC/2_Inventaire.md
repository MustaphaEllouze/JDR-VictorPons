## Rappels

*Menottes*
```
As a Utilize action, you can use Manacles to bind an unwilling Small or Medium creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the Grappled, Incapacitated, or Restrained condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. While bound, a creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls, and the creature is Restrained if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check as an action.

Each set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use Thieves’ Tools to pick the Manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
```

*Chausse-trappe / Caltrops*
```
As a Utilize action, you can spread Caltrops from their bag to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1 Piercing damage and have its Speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Caltrops.
```

*Pied-de-biche*
```
Using a Crowbar gives you Advantage on Strength checks where the Crowbar’s leverage can be applied.
